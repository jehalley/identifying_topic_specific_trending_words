This script scrapes the subreddit topics https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits/wiki/listofsubreddits to make subredd_topics.csv 
that is used to relate a subreddit to its topic.

The formatting on the topics website is inconsistent so some mislabling needed to be corrected by the clean_subreddit_topics_df function
